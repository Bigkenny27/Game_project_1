adding something onto the map should be done in run (or similar function)
first step is to parse the item - make sure it follows naming conventions, ect
second step is to do checks inside the map.
e.g. is the location already occupied by another object?
    is the name already used?
    stuff like that.



object_type is used to check what type of object it is
map_symbol is used to display the symbol that the map will show






All add methods can be fused in the future
